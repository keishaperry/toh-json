It was constructed by the family of Dr. Victor Westphall, whose son, David, was killed in a 1968 enemy ambush in Vietnam, near Con Thien. The memorial is not only a tribute to the 16 Marines who died in that battle, but to all members of America’s armed forces.<br><br>The Vietnam Veterans National Memorial has become a State Park that provides along with the memorial, a Visitors Center that serves as a place for reunion, reflection, healing, and sharing of experiences. https://bit.ly/2t0vZJ5<br><br>There are many stories behind the building of this veterans memorial during a time when it was unpopular to do so, but Doc Westphall persevered and it was dedicated in 1971, on the third anniversary of the death of his son. <br><br>One story is about how the Peace and Brotherhood Chapel came to remain open 24 hours a day. When Doc Westphall was building the chapel, he was locking the doors at night. One morning he found a note scrawled on a piece of scrap plywood that read, “Why did you lock the doors when I needed to come in?” Since then the doors have never been locked.<br><br>The Run for the Wall motorcycle riders make Angel Fire and Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park one of their first stops on their trip to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. Up to 500 motorcycles visit the Memorial on Friday, the weekend before Memorial Day. http://www.rftw.org/<br><br>There is also a (biker-type) motorcycle rally in the nearby town of Red River, every Memorial Day weekend. Most of the riders visit the Memorial during the rally which up to 20,000 motorcyclists attend. https://bit.ly/38KQFUF<br><br>Made in America: For a good pizza, try Angel Fired Pizza https://www.angelfiredpizza.com/ Closed Mondays.<br><br>Instructions: Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.

The first class consisted of thirty-eight students, more than half were female students. The school provided the only high school education in Southeastern New Mexico, focusing on military training as well as academic subjects. The female students were not subject to the same military discipline as the boys but did drill daily with wands instead of rifles.<br><br>Alumni Memorial Plaza, whose outline is in the shape of the New Mexico flag’s Zia sun sign, is dedicated to 1st Lt. William D. DeSanders, a B-17 pilot and member of the class of 1940. His larger-than-life statue sculpted by Roswell oilman and artist Rogers Aston stands in the middle of the plaza. Bronze statues also sculpted by Aston of soldiers from the First and Second World Wars, Korean War, and Vietnam War at each of the four corners of the plaza commemorate the alumni who served in those conflicts. Aston’s close attention to detail reflects careful research.<br><br>DeSanders graduated with the class of 1940 and became a B-17 Flying Fortress pilot that participated in bombing runs over Germany. Before his 23rd mission he became ill and a substitute pilot took his plane that was subsequently shot down over Hamburg.

This is where the only known female Buffalo Soldier, Cathay Williams (a.k.a. William Cathey), served. <br><br>After the capture of Geronimo in 1886, the Apache threat was removed and deactivating the fort was discussed. The excellent health record of the post was brought up and it was transferred to the Surgeon General’s Department in 1900. It became a leading institution for pulmonary tuberculosis research, and is presently a long term care nursing facility and chemical dependency treatment center.<br><br>Made in America: For a great ride, take Hwy. 15 to Hwy. 152 to Lorenzo via Hwy 35, or the reverse.<br><br>Instructions: Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.
