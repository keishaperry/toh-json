There was one boxcar for each state of the union, with a 49th for the District of Columbia. Once arriving in KS, this car and its contents were on display in Topeka then toured 120 Kansas towns over a 140 day period. It is now in front of the Veterans Park in Hays.<br><br>It was appropriate that these small boxcars were used in the Gratitude Train. The boxcars were built between 1852-1885 and were used to transport America’s Infantry and Cavalry to the fighting front during both world wars. Originally, each car was marked with a 40/8, a symbol well recognized by the troops, as each box car would hold 40 men or 8 horses. Known to be a pretty miserable mode of transportation, the boxcars were usually dirty, provided no seats or heat and were cramped. <br><br>At the conclusion of the war a service organization of United States war veterans was formed named after these boxcars, the organization called La Societie des Quarante Hommes et Huit Chevaux, (The Society of Forty Men and Eight Horses). Also known as "40&8" the organization took responsibility for the boxcars when they were received in the US and are still caretakers for most of the cars that remain 52 years later. Many still exist and can be found in each state.<br><br>The Kansas Merci Boxcar has a memorial case on one end of the boxcar, which is used to honor the passing of local veterans for a 30-day period.<br><br>Instructions: Take a photo similar to the one attached, along with rider flag and motorcycle.
