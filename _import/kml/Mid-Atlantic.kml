When it was originally erected there were 36 names on the wall. Since then four others have joined their brothers in sacrifice.<br><br>In the words of Vivian Eney Cross, the widow of a police officer killed in the line of duty, the memorial wall is inscribed:<br><br>“It is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it is how they lived.”<br><br>Made in America: Nearby Dover AFB is home to the Air Mobility Museum which highlights military aviation through exhibits and a collection of aircraft on display. https://amcmuseum.org<br><br>Of course, the Monster Mile is a must stop for NASCAR fans! https://www.doverspeedway.com<br><br>Instructions: Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.

Less than 30 years later Britain was engaged in war with France and distrustful of American expansion. Needing to supplement its naval forces, Britain began to stop American merchant ships on the open seas and impress (force into service) sailors into the Royal Navy believing that anyone born in Britain was still British and subject to the Crown. The United States finally declared war on Britain following blatant seizures of ships and sailors within sight of American shores.<br><br>British vessels blockaded the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays in an effort to disrupt shipping patterns and supply lines. But when crews attempted to land at Lewes for supplies they were repelled by militia.<br><br>The British retaliated with heavy cannon fire from the British ships and rockets. With a large fortification stretching along the canal, local volunteers prevented the British from advancing here with these cannons. The fort in Lewes closed in 1815, immediately after the war.<br><br>Also in the area: Next door is Cannonball House, a maritime museum that still has a cannonball from the blockade lodged in its foundation. https://bit.ly/2OdO11Q The US Lightship Overfalls (http://www.overfalls.org), is one of seven surviving lightships in the United States is moored in Lewes.<br><br>Dogfish Head Brewery (http://www.dogfish.com)’ is an original brewpub located on Rehoboth Ave. in nearby Rehoboth Beach. The Avenue is also home to two Khor Brother’s Frozen Custard shops still serving the uniquely East Coast frozen treat since 1919.
