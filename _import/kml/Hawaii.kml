It is now the resting place of some 33,230 U.S. military veterans, many in unmarked graves dated December 7, 1941.<br><br>The Honolulu Memorial is built high on a wall of the crater and overlooks the cemetery, consisting of several elements. A wide staircase extends from the floor of the crater to the “Court of Honor.” Flanked on both sides of the staircase are ten “Courts of the Missing” that include over 28,000 etched names of soldiers MIA from World War II, the Korean Conflict and the Vietnam War. At the base of the staircase is the following inscription: “IN THESE GARDENS ARE RECORDED THE NAMES OF AMERICANS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE TO THEIR COUNTRY AND WHOSE EARTHLY RESTING PLACE IS KNOWN ONLY TO GOD.”<br><br>From the Court of Honor rises Columbia, a 30’ tall female figure, symbolizing the figurehead on the bow of a naval vessel. Beneath her is the inscription, “THE SOLEMN PRIDE THAT MUST BE YOURS TO HAVE LAID SO COSTLY A SACRIFICE UPON THE ALTAR OF FREEDOM.” Those were the words of Abraham Lincoln told to a mother of five sons lost in the Civil War.<br><br>Directly behind Columbia is a nondenominational chapel, open to the public at all times. On both sides of the chapel are 12 stunning map panels, representing ten of the major Pacific Theatre battles during World War II, plus one for the Korean Conflict and another for the Vietnam War. Each panel measures approximately 4’ wide and 10’ tall and is made of tile mosaics and crushed glass. Alongside the panels are etched marble history lessons.

The memorial was dedicated on 28 March, 1946 by Mr. Earl M. Finch of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. <br><br>After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, over 1,000 Nisei (American children of Japanese parents) of the Hawaiian National Guard were sent to the US mainland where they became the 100th Infantry Battalion. In early 1943, they were sent to train at Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg, along with members of the 442nd Infantry Regiment, also made up of Nisei soldiers. The soldiers weren’t welcome at the local USO canteen and were generally mistrusted by the local population. Mr. Finch was sympathetic to their plight and started inviting them to his house, and organized the Aloha Canteen, the only USO canteen for Japanese-American soldiers. He would also write letters to Nisei soldiers deployed in Europe, and would visit the families of Nisei soldiers killed in combat.

Eight other naval vessels were sunk or badly damaged. 188 aircraft were destroyed at nearby airfields. 2,402 people died, 1,247 were wounded.<br><br>Two of the battleships, one being the USS Arizona, still lie on the bottom along with the 1,177 bodies of sailors caught below deck that day.<br><br>In spite of all that’s been written about Pearl Harbor, nothing comes close to a visit in person to this world-renowned memorial and Hawaii’s largest tourist attraction. Anyone with the slightest interest in military history should make a trip here at least once.<br><br>Pick up your ticket and then board the Navy tender that ferries visitors to the monument straddling the USS Arizona. Once there, visitors are free to walk about, take in the exhibits, smell the still-leaking fuel after 65 years, and talk with the docents. One elderly docent claims, “It’s the best job I’ve ever had and I don’t get paid for it.”<br><br>One story is about what happened when a Pearl Harbor survivor passed away. The family is given the option of a military ceremony on the memorial complete with 21-gun salute. If the honoree was cremated, a team of two Navy divers hold the urn aloft for a last chance for the family to see it, then dove down to place it into the ship’s hold, a permanent resting place alongside his comrades. Ask the docents about the baby’s ashes interred on the nearby USS Utah. Or about the outdated anti-aircraft guns that caused so many civilian casualties. So many stories....<br><br>Get there early because the tours fill up fast. Also includes an excellent video program on the events leading up to December 7 and how the surprise attack shook America to it’s core. An auditory tour is available, narrated by Ernest Borgnine. Removal of hats is advised on the memorial site.<br><br>Made in America: One can spend hours in the gift shop itself, or visit the many outdoor exhibits around the nearby USS Bowfin Submarine Museum. http://www.bowfin.org/museum<br><br>Nearby is a memorial with 52 plaques honoring the downed submarines from World War II, and the names of each of the submariners. <br><br>Outdoor exhibits include examples of torpedoes used in the war, including steam-driven, electric, harpoon and missile-torpedos.<br><br>Made in Hawaii: You may want to refer to this handcrafted list of Oahu dining establishments by rider Michael Bowe-Rahming of Converse, Texas, former resident of Honolulu. https://bit.ly/38F5h7O<br><br>Instructions: Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.
