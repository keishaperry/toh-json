Ernie West on the top of the wall, who still lives in nearby Wurtland, and Worthington resident Cpl. John Collier, posthumously awarded the CMOH.<br><br>West’s citation reads:<br>“Pfc. West distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy. He voluntarily accompanied a contingent to locate and destroy a reported enemy outpost. Nearing the objective, the patrol was ambushed and suffered numerous casualties. Observing his wounded leader lying in an exposed position, Pfc. West ordered the troops to withdraw, then braved intense fire to reach and assist him. While attempting evacuation, he was attacked by 3 hostile soldiers employing grenades and small-arms fire. Quickly shifting his body to shelter the officer, he killed the assailants with his rifle, then carried the helpless man to safety. He was critically wounded and lost an eye in this action. but courageously returned through withering fire and bursting shells to assist the wounded. While evacuating 2 comrades, he closed with and killed 3 more of the foe. Pfc. West’s indomitable spirit, consummate valor, and intrepid actions inspired all who observed him, reflect the highest credit on himself, and uphold the honored traditions of the military service.”<br><br>Collier’s citation reads:<br>“On September 19, 1950, near Chindong-ni, Korea, Cpl. John Collier, Company C, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action. While engaged in an assault on a strategic ridge strongly defended by a fanatical enemy, the leading elements of his company encountered intense automatic weapons and grenade fire. Cpl. Collier and three comrades volunteered and moved forward to neutralize an enemy machine gun position which was hampering the company’s advance, but they were twice repulsed. On the third attempt, Cpl. Collier, despite heavy enemy fire and grenade barrages, moved to an exposed position ahead of his comrades, assaulted and destroyed the machine gun nest, killing at least four enemy soldiers. <br><br>“As he returned down the rocky, fire-swept hill and joined his squad, an enemy grenade landed in their midst. Shouting a warning to his comrades, he, selflessly and unhesitatingly, threw himself upon the grenade and smothered its explosion with his body. This intrepid action saved his comrades from certain death or injury. Cpl. Collier’s supreme, personal bravery, consummate gallantry, and noble self-sacrifice, reflect untold glory upon himself and uphold the honored traditions of the military service.”<br><br>Made in America: It’s a short ride west to Greenbo Lake State Resort Park, 965 Lodge Road in Greenup, to have lunch at the Angler’s Cove Restaurant. Then, with a happy belly, pick one of the three amazing motorcycling routes that the park recommends. 28, 62 miles or 102 miles long around the park. http://bit.ly/3a2O1Lu<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.

The bronze statue of three service members honors women of the past, present and future of the military. A woman with a 1940s haircut, skirt and clipboard represents the clerical jobs in the early days of women’s full enlistment in the military. A kneeling woman in combat fatigues, sunglasses, helmet and carrying a rifle faces east. A commanding officer with regalia and ribbons salutes while facing the American flag in the park. They evoke the enormous sacrifices women have made, and are presently making, in military service, said Stephen Tirone, a Marine and artist who created the sculpture. <br><br>Made in America: If you want to cool off with an ice cream or milk shake, stop by the West Liberty icon Freezer Fresh Dairy, just a couple blocks NW of here. They also serve fried chicken, burgers, dogs and grilled cheese. http://bit.ly/380FxCM<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle. Refer to RULES 6-8 (http://www.tourofhonor.com/pages/rules.html#rules57) for photo verification. Scorers have final say whether standards are met.]]></description>
