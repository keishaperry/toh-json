Linton Doucet, a three tour Korean War veteran and Lafourche Parish native, along with a small group of other veterans are the driving force behind the park, which began with the wall and has since blossomed into an impressive display honoring those who have put their lives on the line for our freedom.<br><br>It’s a beautiful piece of work, now with 3,000 names etched into a wall of black granite. Names will be added as needed to honor those who continue to give the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and their country. At the entrance, a granite wall reading “Freedom Is Not Free” sets the tone for a walk through documented history. At night, a single eternal flame flickers atop the statement in remembrance. A pathway lined with flags sets the tone for a row of statues depicting women in combat, a mother’s loss of her child…. <br><br>Other statues usher visitors to the steps of the great wall, willing each person that walks the grounds to stop, pause, and acknowledge. Nearby stands a reflecting pool complete with an ever-watchful golden guardian angel as well as a sailor, a dedication to those that risked their lives at sea. At the pool’s eastern edge sits the Field of Tears, a 300-foot square walking path decorated with 50 images of those lost to war reflected in etched pieces of granite around the inner perimeter of the trail.<br><br>Mr. Doucet recalls of the initial idea for the park, “The veterans were dying at 1,200 a day and all we ever had was just a picture in the newspaper with a few words and that was it. I said, ‘Well, we’ve got to do better than that for the veterans.’<br><br>“We are proud of what we are doing and enjoying the community getting involved,” he says. “Now, sometimes the school busses come loaded and the kids love to come with a pencil and paper and etch the name of the one in the service that belonged to their family. I always like to tell them, ‘You can say what you want, but every family has veteran blood in them.’”<br><br>Whether it’s Po-Boys, fast food or oriental food, it is all available in the local area.<br><br>Instructions: Take a photo similar to the one attached, along with rider flag and motorcycle.
