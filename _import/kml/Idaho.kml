It was no small task establishing Hawkbill's sail as the only known "Submarine in the Desert." But because of Arco's history in nuclear power development, town enthusiasts latched onto the idea, and when Hawkbill was decommissioned in 2001, the Naval Historical Society donated it to them.<br><br>Arco, with a population of 1,023, was the site where nuclear propulsion for submarines began. During the Cold War, all of southeast Idaho was a hotbed of nuclear testing and advancements - but because their studies were classified, no one knew about it.<br><br>Over the last several decades, some 40,000 sailors trained in nuclear operations at three prototype nuclear power plants in the Arco region. When you visit, you may be met by one of the “docents” who either sailed on the Hawkbill, or worked on the power plants.<br><br>Hawkbill's illustrious history was recounted at the dedication by its last commanding officer, Capt. Robert Perry, who with some emotion, told of its 29 years of missions. To his side stood an American flag that once flew from the decommissioned sub.<br><br>"I estimate that Hawkbill steamed almost 1.5 million miles," Perry said. "Most of what Hawkbill did on her deployments remains classified to this day, but I can guarantee you that Hawkbill's crews significantly contributed to our country's victory in the Cold War."<br><br>The submarine deployed 10 times to the Pacific and six times to the Arctic Ocean, where it joined the National Science Foundation in several crucial studies at the North Pole. Perry described using the sail as a battering ram to break through three feet of ice - a dramatic event that the crew found both jarring and exciting.<br><br>Made in America: Pickle's Place is only a stone's throw on the opposite side of the Hwy from the memorial. The menu includes their famous deep-fried pickles and The Atomic Burger comes with an over generous addition of "mushrooms” for obvious reasons. The Deli Sandwich Shop at 119 N Idaho St. makes large Hoagies and deli sandwiches, also very good eating.<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.

The people owe a debt to those who have given their lives, and the peace officers of this state want this memory to stay fresh in the minds of the citizens. That is why we must reflect during this time set aside to reflect on courage and sacrifice; and, to assure that their loss will not be forgotten, and the survivors will always be a part of the law enforcement community.<br><br>Constructed and dedicated May 15, 1998, the Memorial is designed as a five-point badge laid in a red bricked walkway.
