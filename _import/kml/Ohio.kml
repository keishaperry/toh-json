And there's a 9/11 memorial featuring a 7000 lb antenna that was part of the world trade center, leaning on a Havens-designed 18-foot scale model of the new Freedom Tower. <br><br>The park is also home to a sculpture village that features close to 30 different art sculptures changed out every spring.<br><br>Made in the USA: If you’re hungry, a few blocks from the memorial in the heart of this small town is a place called Kate & Al’s Bar & Grill, where you’ll find good burgers, friendly people and cater to a hometown experience. http://bit.ly/2QUk9cp<br><br>Instructions: Take a photo similar to the one attached, along with rider flag and motorcycle.

Some township records indicate the hours are 8AM-8PM but there are no restrictions to access. Please be respectful of the small town should your visit be during other hours.<br><br>For such a small town to have such a large memorial park is a testament to their patriotism. Among the park’s highlights is the UH-1 helicopter, tail number 65-09587. It is easy to overlook the fact that most static display pieces have a history of their own.<br><br>The Army purchased 65-09587 in December 1965. Originally a D model, it was sent to Vietnam and assigned to the 173rd Assault Helicopter Company. Records show the aircraft as being in service with the 173rd AHC unit until August 25, 1967. On that date the aircraft was involved in a major accident. The information available is as follows:<br><br>Aircraft Commander: Warrant Officer D.F. Jordan<br>Pilot: J.D. Colquitt<br>Crew Chief: A. M. Scheer<br>Door Gunner: G. J. Glappa<br>Total Flight Hours at this point: 1509<br><br>Accident Summary: The engine failed as a loud noise was heard. Suspect that foreign damage caused the N-1 turbine failure. The aircraft was set down in a pineapple field in five-foot scrub brush. There were 0 injuries.<br><br>Close examination reveals that the aircraft has several bullet holes that have been patched along with other major repairs. Records further indicate that the aircraft was shipped back to the United States and it appears to have been in maintenance until May of 1968 when it was assigned to the 355th Aviation Co., 4th Army, Fort Sill, Oklahoma. It shows up briefly in maintenance again at Corpus Christi, TX in 1975, and that is where it was probably converted to an H model. The records available end in December 1975. At that time 587 had 4756 total hours logged. The Auglaize Township Historical Society took possession of the aircraft from the National Guard at North Canton, Ohio in April of 1996 for static display.<br><br>Today, 587 proudly displays the markings and colors of the 176th Assault Helicopter Company, 14th Combat Aviation Battalion, Americal Division, Chu Lai, Republic of South Vietnam.<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.

In October 1972, the museum dedicated the first memorial with a commemorative tree and plaque recognizing Americans held as Prisoners of War by the North Vietnamese and those missing in action during the Southeast Asia Conflict.

Follow Bong St to the end. Security measures in place and there is a motorcycle-only parking area directly adjacent to the Park.<br><br>Made In America: It doesn’t get any more Made In America than the National Museum of the Air Force, the “world’s largest military aviation museum.” Admission is free and you could easily spend an entire day here, if not longer.

The cornerstone of the section is a surviving beam from the wreckage of the World Trade Center that serves as a symbol and reminder of a first responders commitment and sacrifice that day and every day. The 13,000 pound section of beam and structural steel is welded onto the end of the beam is a jib off of a 1940’s era Bucyrus Erie Crane which signifies a fire truck ladder.  At the end of the jib, a weighted cable holds an American Flag that was flown over the United States Capitol. <br><br>It is fastened to an octagonal 70 yard reinforced concrete base which stands 9 1/2 feet tall, designed in the shape of a bolt, symbolizing the American sprit which rebuilt Ground Zero.  The beam points 1 degree south from due east directly at the World Trade Center.  The monument’s name itself is taken from the “Last Call” ritual, which is observed during the service of a fallen police officer or firefighter.<br><br>In 2017, the final piece of the memorial was poured, molded, polished and rang signifying the most touching tribute done at firefighter funerals. This one of a kind bell was made on site by The Verdin Bell Company with the world’s only bell foundry on wheels. 500 pounds of metal consisting of 12 bronze ingots weighing 40 pounds each were melted into molten liquid in just three hours. The bell cooled and hardened overnight. The bell was then released from the mold and then polished for more than four hours. Each bell weighs 250 lbs, stands about two feet tall and rings in the musical note of “E”. This whole process was accomplished in just two days.<br><br>The Sylvania Fire Dept held the inaugural ringing of the bell on September 11th, 2017. <br><br>Made in America: Nearby, you’ll find Tony Packos, famous for their Hungarian hot dogs and pickles. They also have other locations in and around Toledo. https://www.tonypacko.com]]></description>
