Really? When the pig earns $19,000,000 (nearly $200 million in today's money) for the war effort and gets buried with full military honors….absolutely!<br><br>King Neptune was raised by a farmers daughter as a 4H project and donated in 1942 to be served at a fundraising pig roast until a local navy recruiter came up with another idea. Neptune was a hereford swine, a breed characterized as mostly red with a white face, similar to that of the Hereford breed of cattle.<br><br>Navy recruiter Don Lingle, of Anna, Illinois, decided to auction the pig to raise war bonds. Lingle and an auctioneer traveled throughout southern Illinois auctioning Neptune for bonds going to the battleship USS Illinois which was under construction.<br><br>Eventually, all parts of the pig were auctioned; even his squeal was auctioned for $25 on at least one occasion. After each auction, King Neptune was returned to be auctioned again later. High demand for appearances by Neptune led them to travel the rest of Illinois raising funds. The mostly red, with white features, pig was often displayed covered with a blue Navy blanket and wearing a gold crown and silver earrings.<br><br>In 1943, Illinois Gov. Dwight Green purchased King Neptune for $1 million on behalf of the state of Illinois. At the same auction, one of Neptune's bristles was sold for $500. Most of the 700-lb. hog's appearances were sponsored by local Elks clubs and King Neptune was a life member of chapters in Marion, Freeport, and Harrisburg.<br><br>In 1946, King Neptune died of pneumonia on a farm near his birthplace, two days prior to his 8th birthday.<br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.

Based on testimony of Charlie Birger himself, the Shelton Brothers were convicted for a 1925 unsolved mail carrier robbery of $15,000 and sentenced to 25 years. They were released just a few years later. <br><br>After serving their time, the Shelton brothers built a new criminal empire. Based out of East St. Louis, one of the most prosperous cities of its day, they controlled all vice from Peoria and southward.<br><br>They met their demise at the hands of the Chicago mob and an insider, Charles "Blackie" Harris. Blackie’s most notable victim was Carl Shelton, the leader, when he was ambushed several miles southeast of Fairfield, shot from his Jeep. Bernie Shelton was killed at his Peoria roadhouse.

Truman are engraved on the walls. <br><br>The Illinois Purple Heart Memorial honors recipients of the Purple Heart killed or wounded from all wars the United States has participated in.

It’s made of marble on the Village Green, surrounded by a marble exhedra (Google it) and a large flagpole. A cenotaph is an "empty tomb" erected in honor of a person or group of persons whose remains are elsewhere. Although dedicated in 1927 as a monument to honor those who died in World War One, plaques listing the names of those who died in other wars, from the Civil War to the War in Iraq have been added. <br><br>The monument also features a narrative frieze telling the story of soldiers in World War One, and an inscription by Dinsmore Ely, a Winnetka resident who died in the war. He wrote this comment in a letter to his family, shortly before he died: "It is an investment not a loss when a man dies for his country."<br><br>We suggest getting off the bike to walk around the cenotaph and see the intricate narrative carved in to the sides. <br><br>Made in America: Talk about contrast. From small farm towns to a very wealthy suburb on Lake Michigan, you’ll see it all in Illinois. Side roads might include a short blast south on Sheridan Rd. to see the Bahai Temple just as you enter Evanston. It’s an absolutely stunning structure. There are also plenty of small parks along the lake where you can cool off in the shade and enjoy the lake breezes. <br><br>Take a photo similar to the one above, along with rider flag and motorcycle.
