Approximately 8,000 dogwood trees were planted as a living memorial to the men and women in the Armed Forces from New Jersey. \n\nThe Blue Star, taken from the blue star in the service flag, was chosen to symbolize the memorial because it was used during World War II on flags and homes of families that had a son or daughter in the service.\n\nThese markers can also be spotted in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Ketichkan, Tok, and Wasilla in Alaska as well as throughout the rest of the United States.",

From this was born the \"Eskimo Scouts\" which was the start of the Alaska Army National Guard. \n\nUnder the leadership of Major \"Muktuk\" Marston, the Alaska Territorial Guard watched the northern shores of Alaska for enemy movement and were instrumental in the battle for Attu, a foreign battle fought on domestic soil. \n\nMany members of the Territorial Guard served in Korea and Vietnam.

They are very welcoming and knowledgeable about the exhibits. Plan on staying awhile, immersing yourself in the eras depicted or hearing the firsthand accounts from the friendly docents. As always, donations are gratefully accepted. \n\nThe Legion of Valor was organized in 1890 in Washington, DC, by a group of Civil War and Indian War Campaign veterans who were recipients of the Medal of Honor. In the beginning, the organizationâ€™s name was \"The Medal of Honor Legion\". The membership was expanded during subsequent campaigns and wars to include recipients of the Army Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross and the Air Force Cross., so the organizationâ€™s name evolved too. They are a service organization dedicated to patriotism, education and recognizing outstanding accomplishments in the community. http://legionofvalor.org/history/",

In 1945, Berlin was isolated and surrounded, 100 miles deep into the Soviet sector. From June of 1948 to May of 1949, the Soviets blockaded Berlin. For 11 months with 270,000 flights into Berlin, the Allies moved over 23 million tons of supplies. The military wings at Norton were directly involved in that effort. The Berlin Wall, itself, stood from 1961 to 1989 separating the city and stopping emigration. \n\nFederal Signal Corpâ€™s Air Raid Siren was first installed (one of two) to alert the population of Norton AFB in the late 40â€™s / early 50â€™s of impending aerial attack in the event of a war. As the Cold War cooled, many of these warning sirens were abandoned in place throughout the USAF installations and in many cities in the USA. A reminder of days gone by, today this Air Raid Siren has taken its place as part of the history of Norton AFB. \n\nNorton AFB Museum: The associated museum is worth a visit. It presents the history of Norton Air Force Base and the importance of the Military Airlift Command role in world-wide movement of troops, equipment and materials. An important display features Col.

Bok Towerâ€™s builders gave the stone to the city in 1929 and it remained in storage until the monument was constructed in 1991. It was then placed at a location beside a nearby lake. \n\nAs years passed, the monument became dirty, vandals damaged it, and tree roots were making it tilt.

The other four suffered major damage. Eight other naval vessels were sunk or badly damaged. 188 aircraft were destroyed at nearby airfields. 2,402 people died, 1,247 were wounded. \n\nTwo of the battleships, one being the USS Arizona, still lies on the bottom along with the 1,177 bodies of sailors caught below deck that day. \n\nIn spite of all whatâ€™s written about Pearl Harbor, nothing comes close to a visit in person to this world-renowned memorial and Hawaiiâ€™s largest tourist attraction. Anyone with the slightest interest in military history should make a trip here at least once. \n\nPick up a free ticket and then board a Navy tender that ferries visitors to the monument straddling the USS Arizona. Once there, visitors are free to walk about, take in the exhibits, smell the still-leaking fuel after 65 years and talk with the docents. One elderly docent claims, \"Itâ€™s the best job Iâ€™ve ever had and I donâ€™t get paid for it.\" \n\nOne story is about what happens when a Pearl Harbor survivor passes away. The family is given the option of a military ceremony on the memorial complete with 21-gun salute. If the honoree was cremated, a team of two Navy divers hold the urn aloft for a last chance for the family to see it, then dives down to place it into the shipâ€™s hold, a permanent resting place alongside his comrades. Ask the docents about the baby's ashes interred on the nearby USS Utah. Or about the outdated anti-aircraft guns that caused many civilian casualties. So many stories... \n\nGet there early because the tours fill up fast. Also includes an excellent video program on the events leading up to December 7 and how the surprise attack shook America to itâ€™s core. An auditory tour is available, narrated by Ernest Borgnine. Removal of hats is advised on the memorial site.",

I said, â€˜Well, weâ€™ve got to do better than that for the veterans,â€™\" Linton recalls of the initial idea for the park. \n\nItâ€™s a beautiful piece of work, now with 3,000 names etched into a wall of black granite. Names will be added as needed to honor those who continue to give the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and their country. \n\nAt the entrance, a granite wall reading \"Freedom Is Not Free\" sets the tone for a walk through documented history. At night, a single eternal flame flickers atop the statement in remembrance. A pathway lined with flags sets the tone for a row of statues depicting women in combat, a motherâ€™s loss of her childâ€¦. Other statues usher visitors to the steps of the great wall, willing each person that walks the grounds to stop, pause, and acknowledge. \n\nBeyond the wall lies a community gathering place that serves as a place for local veterans to meet. Near the base of the elevated facility stands a reflecting pool complete with an ever-watchful golden guardian angel as well as a sailor, a dedication to those that risked their lives at sea. \n\nAt the poolâ€™s eastern edge sits the Field of Tears, a 300-foot square walking path decorated with 50 images of those lost to war reflected in etched pieces of granite around the inner perimeter of the trail. \n\nMore from Mr. Doucet: \"We are proud of what we are doing and enjoying the community getting involved,\" he says. \"Now, sometimes the school busses come loaded and the kids love to come with a pencil and paper and etch the name of the one in the service that belonged to their family. I always like to tell them, â€˜You can say what you want, but every family has veteran blood in them.â€™\"",

After training at Camp Pendleton, his unit was sent to Iwo Jima and four days after landing, and with six more weeks of fighting ahead, Gagnon was sent to Mt Suricachi to help establish radio communication with the forward unit on the peak. After delivering a replacement battery for the radio, he was asked by the four-man patrol to lend a hand with the heavy pipe and raise the United States flag. He became part of what is likely the most famous flag raising in U.S. history. \n\nInscribed on the plaque are quotes from a famous American leader, and one who is known to almost all Americans, but virtually unknown as well: \n\"Don't glorify war . . . there is no glory in it . . . \" \nPfc Rene A.

Big Bill and a cage full of men unloaded on the surface. But there were more still down there, so back down Big Bill went. Another bell rang and another cage of rescued miners emptied out. \n\nBy now, Big Bill was feeling the fumes but he couldnâ€™t leave anyone to die. So down he went for a third time. This time the ring took a little longer to come but finally the ding came. When the elevator cage emerged from the black smoke it was full of men just like the other times. Except there was no Big Bill this time. One of the semiconscious miners said someone fell out during the ascent. Everyone knew it was Big Bill. His last known words before he went down the final time were: \"Well boys, Iâ€™ve made two trips and Iâ€™m nearly all in, but Iâ€™ll try again.\"",

Initially, the memorial was located on the east end of town at the Memorial Bridge, which was dedicated to WWI veterans. Shortly after the original stone memorial was built, word got out that a VFW post about 3 hours away was moving and had no place for their Sherman Tank. \n\nFor the asking, that tank from Pattonâ€™s 3rd Army was donated to Renovo. Having no funds to transport the tank, a call for help went out, and within days, available were funds, a work detail, and the needed equipment. The \"30 ton\" tank created some issues with road weight restrictions, turning the typical 3 hour drive into a 3+ day event. The tank was no cost to Renovo, outside of the $10 paid for dinner for the three man crew for one evening!  \n\nIn the early 1980s, PennDOT had plans to replace the Memorial Bridge, but said plans did not include saving the memorial. Having the memorial accessible only by steep steps was not acceptable, so local leaders found another site and a \"tank retriever\" was used to pull the Sherman Tank to it.

Prussian General Friedrich von Steuben provided a new training regimen to get the troops ready for their next victory over the British (Battle of Monmouth). Then, Nathanael Greene became quartermaster general, handling procurement logistics (including local foraging missions to garner food, fuel and supplies), allowing Washington to focus on military strategy. And the Continental Congress finally started raising and appropriating more funds for supplies. \n\nFunds to build the arch ($100,000 from Congress) were approved in 1911.

At a crisis point, seven men left the community to seek flour and foodstuffs from surrounding communities. Heavy snow forced the abandonment of wagons and teams, and the men finished their rescue mission on foot, reportedly by laying one quilt after another upon the snow to maintain their footing. \n\nAfter the Black Hawk War with native tribes, the community was temporarily abandoned in 1867 but resettled in 1871. Some residents specializing in timber and livestock production were quite successful until economic shifts following World War I. \n\nWith the establishment of Bryce Canyon National Park and the designation of nearby areas as national forests, tourism has since played a major role in the local economy.",
